INSTALLATION FOR DEVELOPMENT UNDER ECLIPSE

1. Install OpenJDK 6 in your system (in Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk). 

2. Install Git in your system (in Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install git); note: you may also use JGit for 
Eclipse.

3. Download and uncompress 'Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers' from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

4. Run the Eclipse executable.

5. Install the 'Google Plugin for Eclipse' for your version of Eclipse by following the instructions 
in https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/download; you just need to select the plugin itself,
and the Google Web Toolkit SDK and Google App Engine SDK under group 'SDK'.

6. Install the Egit Eclipse plugin by using the URL address in http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/
and selecting it under group 'Collaboration'. 

7. Select 'Import' > 'Projects from Git'; introduce the clone URI for forecaat that you may find 
after clicking on the Clone button in https://github.org/jaspock/forecat/; wait until the 
files have been downloaded and then select 'Import existing project'.

8. The .classpath and the .project files for Eclipse are already included in the repository; the .classpath
only contains relative paths so, in principle, it should not need any review. However, there is a global 
preference option that you need to change to avoid a issue produced by the App Engine SDK: go to 
Window > Preferences > Google > Error,warnings and in the App Engine section set to 'Warning' the option 
'Use of non-whitelisted JRE type' (see the comment before 
org.forecat.server.translation.TranslationServerSide.translateApertiumLocalInstallation for more
information about this).

9. Make sure that Eclipse is using JDK6 for your project by looking at the project properties.

10. Forecat has been tested with Google App Engine SDK for Java 1.7.3 and Google Web Toolkit SDK 2.5; 
in case the application does not work and your Google Plugin for Eclipse includes a different version, 
you may download these versions from https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/downloads/list?can=1&q=java 
and https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/versions, respectively. Make Eclipse use those libraries 
by selecting them under section Google in the project properties. 

11. Install Apertium if you plan to use it from a local installation (also set variable 
org.forecat.server.utils.PropertiesServer.apertiumLocation to LOCAL_APERTIUM).

12. Change org.forecat.client.utils.PropertiesBrowserSide.executionMode to a different value if you know
what you are doing and you need to.

13. Run the project as either a GWT 'Web Application' or as a 'Java Application' (org.forecat.console.Main). 
For the latter, you need to create a file 'forecat.console.properties' with the API keys; put the file in 
the 'resources' directory with a content like this:

apertiumkey = <YOURAPERTIUMKEY>
bingkeyid = <YOUBINGID>
bingkeysecret = <YOURBINGSECRET>

Do not add this file to the repository as it will contain your personal keys.


INSTALLATION FOR COMMAND-LINE (ANT) DEVELOPMENT

There is also a build.xml file included if you prefer to use ant and command line during development. 
You will need to download and install the Google Web Toolkit SDK and set properties 'gwt.sdk' 
and 'junit.path' in the beginning of the file.
